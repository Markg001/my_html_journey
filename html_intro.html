<!--    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

    Itâ€™s the standard language used to create web pages.

    It tells the browser what content to display (like text, links, images, etc.)
     and how it's structured.

    Think of HTML as the bones or skeleton of a website. It doesn't style or color
    the page (CSS does that) and doesn't handle interactions 
    (JavaScript does that). HTML just tells the browser: "This is a heading, 
    this is a paragraph, hereâ€™s an image."-->
 <!--2. Tags, Elements, and Attributes
ðŸ“Œ a) Tags

Tags are special keywords wrapped in angle brackets < >.

There are:

    Opening tags â†’ e.g. <p>

    Closing tags â†’ e.g. </p> (notice the slash)

Tags tell the browser what type of content you're writing:

    <h1> â†’ heading

    <p> â†’ paragraph

    <img> â†’ image (doesnâ€™t need a closing tag)

ðŸ“Œ b) Elements its like a content inside a tag

An element is made of:

    an opening tag

    some content

    a closing tag

Example:

<h1>This is a heading</h1>

    This entire line is an HTML element.

ðŸ“Œ c) Attributes

Attributes provide extra information about an element.

They are always:

    in the opening tag

    written as name="value"

Example:

<img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cute cat" width="200">

Here:

    src â†’ the path to the image

    alt â†’ alternative text if the image doesnâ€™t load

    width â†’ image width in pixels-->

Step-by-Step Breakdown

<!DOCTYPE html>

    Tells the browser: "This is an HTML5 document."

<html>

    The root of your web page. All content goes inside.

<head>
  <title>My First Page</title>
</head>

    The head contains info about the page (not seen directly).

    The <title> is what shows in the browser tab.

<body>
